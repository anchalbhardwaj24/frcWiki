                            <h5><small class="text-muted"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></small></h5>
                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">FRC Programming can be confusing at first because instead of just
                                writing code and running it on your local machine to print some kind of output or view a
                                tangible, usually numerical result, hardware is now put into the mix. While the end goal
                                is clear (drive the robot, move its subparts, follow a path), the ‚Äúhow‚Äù can get a bit
                                complex. In short, FRC Programming encapsulates both hardware and software components
                                that are tied together by programming languages to make robot's perform certain actions.
                            </p>
                            <h5><small class="text-muted"><b>WHAT WE DO</b></small></h5>
                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">Basic driving controls and controls, autonomous actions, and
                                sensor feedback are possible with FRC programming. For example, we can map buttons to
                                various controls and program the Robot to drive using joysticks. It is also possible to
                                have the robot perform actions without controls based on time. Sensor feedback can be
                                done with components such as encoders and gyros; advanced programming uses the feedback
                                to control or plan robot movement. It's important to note that robot actions build on
                                top of each other that almost all parts of a Robot program is interconnected with each
                                other.
                            </p>
                            <h5><small class="text-muted"><b>COMPONENT INTRODUCTION</b></small></h5>
                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">What exactly does the Programming committee program? For FRC, we
                                mainly code the robot's main "computer" called the RoboRIO; it controls the common
                                sensors and actuators used in advanced robotics applications. Sensors essentially allow
                                the robot to get feedback about its environment and use this information to improve
                                robot movement or complete certain tasks. Other hardware components that are involved in
                                FRC programming include the CTRE Power Distribution Panel (PDP), OM5P-AC Radio, CTRE
                                Pneumatics Control Module, Motor Controllers, and much more. Some examples of software
                                components include Visual Studio Code, FRC Driver Station, Smart Dashboard, FRC roboRIO
                                Imaging Tool, and Pathweaver. These components will be introduced in more depth in each
                                section.
                            </p>
                            <h5><small class="text-muted"><b>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</b></small></h5>
                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">This guide is centered around Java, but other languages can also
                                be used, namely C++/C. Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
                                language. Let‚Äôs break that down. A ‚Äúhigh-level‚Äù programming language is one with strong
                                abstraction from the details of the computer. Meaning, the computer understands
                                instructions in machine language (1‚Äôs and 0‚Äôs) but we write in a more human-intuitive
                                language (Java) that is translated into what the computer can understand.
                                ‚ÄúObject-oriented programming‚Äù (OOP) is a programming model that organizes design around
                                data rather than logic and functions; this will become more clear with examples.
                                ‚ÄúClass-based‚Äù is simply a style of OOP in which inheritance happens through defining
                                classes of objects, instead of inheritance occurring through the objects alone.
                                Inheritance, classes, and objects will also be clarified, but this is a brief
                                description to just distinguish Java from other programming languages. It‚Äôs important to
                                have a solid Java (or C++ if that is the language being used) foundation because it
                                would be frustrating to wrangle with syntax errors or conceptual gaps while trying to
                                debug a very niche error.
                            </p>
                            <h5><small class="text-muted"><b>HOW TO USE FRC WIKI</b></small></h5>
                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">These pages are designed to give a quick look into all the moving
                                parts when it comes to FRC programming and help beginner students gain fundamental
                                knowledge of Robot code and logic. Veterans can use this to brush up their knowledge or
                                find out more about exactly how FRC programming works if you're visiting from other
                                committees. Cool things happen when things work! And, it‚Äôs pretty interesting to learn
                                about how we can write in a language that can make a 120 pound robot come to life.
                                Hopefully, this guide to FRC Programming and Java is helpful; we‚Äôve included everything
                                from basic syntax (important!) to how WPILib classes are used to code subsystems.
                                Each section has a collection of slides, lesson plans, and documentation that can be
                                used for general information checks or used to teach rookies FRC programming in an
                                organized, comprehensive format. Slides may be accompanied by videos made by students
                                and approved by mentors. Happy coding!
