                            <p class="fs-6 text-white">Recently, Notre Dame‚Äôs Robotics Team, the Janksters, competed at
                                the FIRST Robotics Competition Monterey Bay Regional, marking their first in-season,
                                in-person tournament since 2019. After more than seven weeks of designing,
                                manufacturing, and programming a robot from scratch, the Janksters brought their vision
                                from blueprints to a 96 pound robot with 6 wheels, 9 motors, 2 sensors, and 3 sub
                                mechanisms. Alongside 36 teams from across California, Team 1967 persevered through 3
                                days of tough qualification matches, numerous setbacks, and incredible elimination
                                rounds.
                                <br><br>
                                Students arrived at Seaside High School at 8:00 every morning and quickly prepared the
                                pit workstation, took their spots on the spectator stands for robot scouting, or met
                                with alliance partners to strategize for upcoming matches. The first day of Monterey Bay
                                was successful despite unprecedented malfunctions and damaged parts. Our pit crew was
                                efficient and organized, passing robot inspection in record time and making it to the
                                practice field in minutes. A series of eight practice matches allowed our students to
                                diagnose and repair our robot, from adjusting current limits to the drivebase motors to
                                fine tuning the autonomous routine. Aside from the anticipation of putting our robot to
                                the test, learning opportunities were abundant at this regional. Students collaborated
                                with event Control System Advisors, received pro tips from Presentation Invasion‚Äôs
                                mentors, and pooled match data with TKO from Archbishop Mitty. The Janksters entered the
                                first day of qualification matches with a tuned robot and high spirits.
                                <br><br>
                                Every student played a crucial role over the course of 12 qualification matches, helping
                                Team 1967 rise up the ranks from 32 to 14th. Our 5-person drive team effectively
                                cooperated with new alliances and made key decisions to clinch wins and showcase our
                                robot‚Äôs consistency in performance. Janksters in the stands diligently recorded details
                                and data points on opposing robots during fieldplay, providing essential information for
                                match strategy. With repairs necessary after nearly every match, pit crew worked
                                relentlessly, replacing entire sub-mechanism parts and deploying new code. Most of all,
                                our cheers roared throughout the stadium after ending the day with a close win of 39-28,
                                bringing our record to an even 6 losses and 6 wins.

                                During Alliance Selections, a ‚Äúserpentine‚Äù style selection process takes place where the
                                top eight teams pick 2 other teams to ally with for the elimination matches. The
                                Janksters were selected to join the fourth ranked alliance with Team 4255, RoboDores,
                                from Monterey High School and Team 3256, WarriorBorgs, from Valley Christian High
                                School. With 4255 and 3256 leveraging their accurate shooting mechanisms, the Janksters
                                played tough defense and won the quarterfinals against the fifth ranked alliance. In the
                                semifinals, our alliance was pitted against the first ranked alliance, led by the
                                defending World Champion, MadTown Robotics. Nevertheless, with the help of quick
                                maneuvers from all three drive teams, a strategic plan derived from scouting data, and
                                critical repairs by the pit crew, the Janksters were able to win the first semifinals
                                match by a harrowing two points, breaking the undefeated streak of MadTown Robotics. The
                                Janksters finished the Monterey Bay Regional as semifinalists, also marking the first
                                time the team has advanced to this round of competition since 2014.
                                <br><br>
                                Giving rookie students a taste of the excitement of FIRST Robotics and giving veterans
                                an invaluable chance to employ their skills, the Monterey Bay Regional was an incredible
                                experience. The Janksters made new milestones this past weekend, but the work has just
                                begun. The team is now preparing for their second competition at the Silicon Valley
                                Regional and working hard to make sure Josh is ready to impress. Go Janksters!
